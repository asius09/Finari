# .env Files - IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------------
# It is generally a good practice to IGNORE ALL .env files from Prettier.
# .env files often contain key-value pairs where the values might be API keys,
# database credentials, or other sensitive information. Prettier's formatting
# (e.g., adding/removing quotes, changing line breaks) could potentially corrupt
# these values or at least make them harder to read/manage if not handled carefully.
# More importantly, you generally don't want these files committed to version control,
# and formatting is less of a concern than security and functionality for them.

.env
.env.* # Catches .env.local, .env.development, .env.production, etc.
!*.env.example # EXCEPT for .env.example, which is often a template
               # and *can* be formatted for consistency.
               # If you want to format .env.example, make sure this line is present and above any
               # .env ignore that would catch it.

# If you specifically want to ignore *all* .env files, including .env.example:
# .env*

# -------------------------------------------------------------
# Optional: Specific file types or folders to ignore
# -------------------------------------------------------------
# For example, if you have a /public folder with many static assets you don't need formatted:
# public/
# However, sometimes you might have SVGs or JSON in public that you *do* want formatted.
# Be judicious with broader ignores.

# Ignore compiled CSS/SCSS (if they are compiled and not source)
# *.css.map
# *.scss.map

# Image files (generally not text-based, so Prettier won't touch them anyway, but good for completeness)
# *.png
# *.jpg
# *.jpeg
# *.gif
# *.svg
# *.ico

# Video/Audio files
# *.mp4
# *.webm
# *.ogg
# *.mp3
# *.wav

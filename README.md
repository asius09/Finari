Okay, this is a fantastic update! It sounds like you're really getting into the practical application and optimization, which is crucial for a real-world tool like Finari. Let's integrate these new goals and re-prioritize the roadmap.

I'll re-sequence some phases to reflect your immediate focus on user settings, data optimization, and historical data, while also adding the Google Auth login phase.

- [x] Line chart for debt repayment over time
- [x] Add filters (monthly, yearly, category-wise)

---

### Phase 5: Assets & Debts Management (In Progress)

- [x] Create assets page with CRUD operations
- [x] Add form for new assets (type, value, description)
- [ ] Display assets in table with sorting/filtering
- **Detail:** Implement a responsive data table component (e.g., using Shadcn UI's DataTable with TanStack Table).
- [ ] Implement edit/delete functionality
- **Detail:** Ensure optimistic updates for a smoother user experience, with rollbacks on API failure.
- [ ] Add asset type categorization (cash, investments, property, etc.)
- **Detail:** Use dropdowns or radio buttons for selection, and store in DB.
- [x] Create debts page with CRUD operations
- [ ] Add form for new debts (type, amount, interest rate, due date)
- **Detail:** Implement "inline dropdowns" for units (e.g., tenure unit, repayment frequency unit) and currency display within input fields.
- [ ] Display debts in table with sorting/filtering
- **Detail:** Similar to assets, use a responsive data table.
- [ ] Implement edit/delete functionality
- **Detail:** Apply optimistic updates and robust error handling.
- [ ] Add debt type categorization (loans, credit cards, mortgages, etc.)
- **Detail:** Use dropdowns or radio buttons for selection.
- [ ] Add net worth calculation (assets - debts)
- **Detail:** Implement a helper function or Redux selector to derive net worth from state. Display on dashboard.
- [ ] Create visualizations for assets/debts breakdown
- **Detail:** Use pie/donut charts for category distribution and bar charts for total assets/debts over time.

---

### Phase 6: User Profile & Settings (Next Immediate Focus)

**Goal:** Allow users to manage their profile and application preferences, including updating their data.

- [ ] Create **Settings Page** with distinct sections:
- [ ] **Profile Management:**
- [ ] Display user's current profile data (name, email, etc.).
- [ ] Implement **"User Update" forms** for necessary inputs (e.g., name, email, avatar URL).
- [ ] Implement change password functionality (requires current password verification).
- [ ] Handle updating user data in Supabase `auth.users` table and/or a `profiles` table.
- [ ] **Account Preferences:**
- [ ] Theme selection (light/dark/system).
- [ ] Default currency setting.
- [ ] Date format options.
- [ ] **Notification Settings:**
- [ ] Placeholder for future email notification preferences.
- [ ] Placeholder for future push notification settings.
- [ ] **Security Settings:**
- [ ] Implement **Google OAuth Login** integration with Supabase.
- [ ] Manage connected social accounts (Google).
- [ ] Option to enable/disable 2FA (Future consideration, not part of initial Google Auth).

---

### Phase 7: App Optimization & Data Handling (Ongoing Focus)

**Goal:** Improve app performance, data presentation, and prepare for historical data.

- [ ] **Test Current App Features & Optimize:**
- [ ] Comprehensive testing of existing functionalities (Auth, Dashboard, Add Forms).
- [ ] Identify performance bottlenecks (e.g., large data fetches).
- [ ] Refactor and improve codebase for maintainability and efficiency while documenting.
- [ ] **Enhance Filters:**
- [ ] Improve existing filters for transactions, assets, debts.
- [ ] Add more granular filtering options (e.g., custom date ranges, specific merchants/payees, exact amounts).
- [ ] Ensure filter state persists across navigation or is easily reset.
- [ ] **Transactions Page Optimization:**
- [ ] Implement **pagination/infinite scrolling** to show limited transactions per view (e.g., 20-50 per load) and fetch more on scroll/button click.
- [ ] Improve transaction page layout to be more aligned and responsive (e.g., a well-structured table or grid, optimized for small devices).
- [ ] **Temporary History Data (Simplified View):**
- [ ] Create a basic, simple way to view historical data for key metrics (e.g., total income/expenses per month, net worth snapshot). This could be a static list or simple summary cards.
- [ ] Focus on data aggregation that is easy to query and display initially.
- [ ] **Small Device Friendly:**
- [ ] Continuously review and optimize UI for mobile and tablet responsiveness (adjusting layouts, font sizes, spacing).

---

### Phase 8: Comprehensive Historical Data & Reports (Next Major Phase)

**Goal:** Implement robust historical data tracking and advanced reporting features.

- [ ] **Historical Data Implementation:**
- [ ] Ensure all relevant data points (transactions, asset values, debt balances) are timestamped for historical tracking.
- [ ] Implement backend queries to aggregate historical data efficiently (e.g., monthly snapshots of net worth, balances).
- [ ] Display historical data in interactive charts (e.g., Net worth timeline, asset value over time) with **real-time updates** (as data changes, charts reflect).
- [ ] **Export Functionality:**
- [ ] Implement exporting of transaction data (and possibly other data) to common formats:
- [ ] CSV data export (client-side implementation).
- [ ] Excel files.
- [ ] PDF report generation (consider serverless function for complex reports).
- [ ] **Build Dedicated Reports Page:**
- [ ] Monthly/yearly financial summary.
- [ ] Income vs expense comparison (e.g., side-by-side bars).
- [ ] Asset allocation breakdown (e.g., pie chart of asset types).
- [ ] Debt repayment progress (e.g., line chart of outstanding balance).
- [ ] Add advanced filtering options (date range, categories, custom grouping).
- [ ] Visualization customization (chart type selection, color schemes).

---

### Phase 9: Smart Reminders (Revisited)

**Goal:** Allow users to set custom reminders for financial obligations (EMIs, bills, etc.) and receive notifications.

- [ ] Design UI for setting custom reminders (EMIs, bills)
- **Detail:** Create a modal/drawer form with fields for reminder name, amount, due date (date picker), frequency (one-time, recurring with options), and notification preferences.
- [ ] Store reminder data in DB
- **Detail:** Utilize the `reminders` table with fields like `id`, `user_id`, `name`, `amount`, `due_date`, `frequency`, `last_notified_at`, `next_notification_date`, `is_completed`, and potentially `associated_entity_id` (linking to debts/bills). Implement RLS policies.
- [ ] Use Supabase Edge Functions or CRON jobs to trigger email/push
- **Detail:** Set up a daily/hourly Edge Function to query `reminders`. Implement notification logic via SendGrid (emails). Update reminder state after sending.
- [ ] Display upcoming reminders on dashboard
- **Detail:** Create a dedicated card or section on the dashboard to show a list of the next 3-5 upcoming reminders. Allow users to mark reminders as "completed."

---

### Phase 10: Currency Management

**Goal:** Provide multi-currency support and conversion tools.

- [ ] Integrate free currency conversion API (via Edge Function proxy).
- [ ] Add currency converter widget.
- [ ] Implement real-time exchange rates and historical rate viewing.
- [ ] Create currency settings (default display currency).
- [ ] Add multi-currency support for data entry.
- [ ] Implement currency conversion for all displayed values.
- [ ] Add currency conversion features (inline conversion, bulk for reports, formatting).

---

### Phase 11: AI Assistant (Future)

**Goal:** Integrate AI to provide smart financial insights and assistance.

- [ ] Connect OpenAI API (via secure Edge Function).
- [ ] Train prompt for smart financial summaries, budgeting tips, spending spike detection.
- [ ] UI assistant (chat-based or smart cards for proactive insights).

---

### Phase 12: Password Vault (Optional)

**Goal:** A secure place for users to store sensitive login credentials.

- [ ] Create `vault_items` table with encrypted fields.
- [ ] Implement **client-side encryption** using user-derived key (master password/PIN).
- [ ] Create secure UI to view/add/delete vault items (masked passwords, show/hide toggle).
- [ ] Implement master password/PIN for extra safety (never sent to server).

---

### Bonus: Polish & Launch

- [ ] Responsive design testing across various devices and screen sizes.
- [ ] Create Notion-style documentation for app usage and features.
- [ ] Setup self-hosted or Vercel deployment.
- [ ] Add minimal onboarding guide for first-time users.
- [ ] **Natural Language Logging (Future):** Allow users to input transactions/data using natural language (e.g., "Spent $50 on groceries yesterday at XYZ store"). This would likely involve an AI model to parse the input.
